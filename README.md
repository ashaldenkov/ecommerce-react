## Run Locally

Notes about assignment:
I used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system combined with flex-column inside the card so content stretches vertically, ensuring consistent heights. Product images use object-fit: contain for responsiveness, maintaining proportions without distortion. The button area sticks to the bottom for better alignment across cards, and the layout scales from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size.

If you would like, check my other protfolio e-commerce project, it was much easier to make it since I used the modern stack like Tailwind or ShadCN

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://dredsoft-labs-admin@bitbucket.org/dredsoft-labs/ecommerce.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd ecommerce
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install

  or 

  npm install react-material-ui-carousel --save --legacy-peer-deps
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

The server should now be running. You can access the application by opening a web browser and entering the following URL:

```bash
  http://localhost:3000
```
